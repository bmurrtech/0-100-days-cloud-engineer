## Day 1
- Started a course I thought would be everything I needed to become a DevOps Cloud Engineer
- First 5 hours into the course was all about the history of DevOps: agile, social coding, collaboration of developers and operations, etc.
- Listened to a cloud engineer livestream interview of an IT professional’s story of how he transitioned to cloud engineering.
- He was already employed, so he just networked with the cloud manager
- He learned what skills a cloud engineer needed
- He has CCNA certification (networking skills that came in handy later)
- He started AWS certification training
- He later realized that he lacked basic Linux, Bash scripting, and Python skills
- He started Python on codecademy, completed 50% and got hired as a jr. cloud engineer months later (he said codecademy it is worth every penny)

## Day 2

- Ditched the first DevOps IBM course to deep-dive into research of what it really takes to be a cloud engineer
- Started searching job listings for the top required and most common skills mentioned
- Watched free content on YouTube to learn more about the primary DevOp skills required in real-life applications
- Chose a cloud service (AWS, Azure, Google) to pursue certification
- Paid for Coursera Plus (1yr)
- Searched for “Coursera Plus” and “Shareable Certificate” courses that checked all the boxes for key cloud engineering skills
- Found courses for Linux LFCA Certification, Google Cloud Associate certification prep, and Python
- Created roadmap and timeline (visualizing my goals)

## Day 3
- Completed required job skill research
- Completed creating learning roadmap by identifying key courses and optimizing for maximum learning to hours invested ratio
- Purchased [bmurr.tech](https://www.bmurr.tech) domain name with SSL and email mailbox
- Created custom domain email box
- Created a GitHub account to track and demonstrate my [0-100 days to Cloud Engineer progress](https://github.com/bmurrtech/0-100-days-cloud-engineer/blob/main/daily_journal.md)
- Made a stunning [About Me Github page](https://github.com/bmurrtech)
- Learned about and started utilizing [basic markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

### Learning About Linux History and Distributions
- Enrolled into Linux Fundamentals (Learn Quest) course through Coursera Plus subscription
- Started Week 1 of the course
- Learned the history of Linux. Did you know that the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, was going to originally name it “Freax?” It is a combination or portmanteau of the two words “free” and “freak.”
-  Learning about Linux Distribtuions (i.e. Red Hat Enterprise Linux a.k.a. RHEL, 02-22-2000)
- RedHat is a subsidiary of IBM and targets server software for the commerical market
- CentOS is a redistribution with RedHat intellectual property (IP)
- Fedora Linux (11-06-2003) is more innovative (many releases) vs. RHEL philosophy which focuses on stability over innovation
- SUSE (soo-see) a German-based open-source tech company (09-2-1992); owned by Novell from 2003-2011
- Ubuntu is based on Debian (major category of distribution); free to download; ideal for desktop, server, core IoT devices, and robets (note about support: every two years a new update is released and long-term support is offered for 5 years total)
- Debian comes in stable, testing, and untested; similar to Ubuntu but Debian focuses on freedom (community-driven)

### Linux Command Lines 1
- Resource: [Linux CLI Intro Guide](https://linuxjournal.com/content/linux-command-line-interface-introduction-guide)
- 90% of the cloud is Linux based
- ssh is faster than interacting with a GUI
- the "bourne shell" is represented by the $ character to prompt the user for input

| Command | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| pwd | returns the path of the current working directory (dir) |
| cd | change dir |
| cd .. | move on dir up |
| cd to | go straight to home folder |
| cd - | move to your prev dir |
| ls -r | will list all the files in the sub-directories as well |
| ls -a | will show the hidden files |
| ls -al | will list the files and dir with detailed info (ex. permissions, size, owner) |
| cat | list the contents of a file on the standard output |
| cat > filename | creates a new file |
| cat > filename1 filename2>filename3 | joins 2 files and stores the output of them in a new file |
| cp | copy files |
| mv | move or rename files |
| mkdir | create a new dir in the current dir |
| rm | remove file and directories|
| rm -r | remove dir and all files inside |
| clear | to clear the screen and start all over |
| history | will show a historal list of commands that were entered in the terminal session |
