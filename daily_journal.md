# Road to Cloud Dev in 100 Days
Follow my daily journey to becoming a certified Cloud Engineer.

>He who aims at perfection
>will probably miss the mark,
>but he who aims at nothing,
>is sure to hit it every time.”
>(Henry Wheeler Shaw, 1876)

## Day 1
- Started a course I thought would be everything I needed to become a DevOps Cloud Engineer
- First 5 hours into the course was all about the history of DevOps: agile, social coding, collaboration of developers and operations, etc.
- Listened to a cloud engineer livestream interview of an IT professional’s story of how he transitioned to cloud engineering.
- He was already employed, so he just networked with the cloud manager
- He learned what skills a cloud engineer needed
- He has CCNA certification (networking skills that came in handy later)
- He started AWS certification training
- He later realized that he lacked basic Linux, Bash scripting, and Python skills
- He started Python on codecademy, completed 50% and got hired as a jr. cloud engineer months later (he said codecademy it is worth every penny)

## Day 2

- Ditched the first DevOps IBM course to deep-dive into research of what it really takes to be a cloud engineer
- Started searching job listings for the top required and most common skills mentioned
- Watched free content on YouTube to learn more about the primary DevOp skills required in real-life applications
- Chose a cloud service (AWS, Azure, Google) to pursue certification
- Paid for Coursera Plus (1yr)
- Searched for “Coursera Plus” and “Shareable Certificate” courses that checked all the boxes for key cloud engineering skills
- Found courses for Linux LFCA Certification, Google Cloud Associate certification prep, and Python
- Created roadmap and timeline (visualizing my goals)

## Day 3
- Completed required job skill research
- Completed creating learning roadmap by identifying key courses and optimizing for maximum learning to hours invested ratio
- Enrolled into Linux Fundamentals (Learn Quest) course through Coursera Plus subscription
- Started Week 1 of the course
- Learned the history of Linux. Did you know that the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, was going to originally name it “Freax?” It is a combination or portmanteau of the two words “free” and “freak.”
- Purchased [bmurr.tech](https://www.bmurr.tech) domain name with SSL and email mailbox
- Created custom domain email box
- Created a GitHub account to track and demonstrate my 0-100 days to Cloud Engineer progress
- Made a stunning [About Me Github page](https://github.com/bmurrtech)
